# TaskForge

**Full-stack team project management** — organizations, role-based membership, drag-and-drop Kanban boards, task comments and attachments, dashboard analytics, and notifications. A simplified Trello / Asana / Jira, built in two parts:

- **`taskforge-backend/`** — Express 5 + PostgreSQL REST API with JWT auth, role-based access control, a normalized schema, transactional drag-and-drop, and a growing test suite.
- **`taskforge-frontend/`** — React + Vite client wired directly to that API. No mock data — every screen reads and writes through real REST calls.

The through-line: **every rule is enforced at the right layer.** The database constrains what can exist, the API constrains who can do what, and the UI merely reflects those rules back to the user.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Backend (see taskforge-backend/README.md)
cd taskforge-backend
npm install
# edit .env -> DATABASE_URL for your Postgres, then:
npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed
npm start                      # http://localhost:3000

# 2. Frontend (new terminal)
cd taskforge-frontend
npm install
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:5173
```

Sign in with a demo identity (password `password123`):

| User   | Role   |
| ------ | ------ |
| Donna  | Owner  |
| Marcus | Admin  |
| Priya  | Member |
| Leo    | Viewer |

The role changes what the UI permits — and every permission is enforced server-side by role-guarded routes, not just hidden buttons.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Vite dev server with API proxy
npm run build     # production build to dist/
npm run preview   # serve the production build
npm run lint      # eslint over src/
```

### Backend

**Runtime & modules.** Node.js with native ES modules and **subpath imports** for clean internal resolution:

- `#db/*` — database client and queries
- `#middleware/*` — auth, validation, error handling
- `#routes/*` — Express routers

**Express 5 patterns.**

- **Nested routers with `mergeParams: true`** — tasks mount under boards, boards under organizations, with parent params flowing down naturally.
- **`router.param()` middleware** — centralizes 404 handling and attaches the loaded record to `req`, so route handlers never re-fetch or re-check existence.
- **`requireBody` validation middleware** — declarative required-field checks before any handler runs.
- **Central error handler** — maps PostgreSQL error codes (`23505` unique violation, `23503` foreign-key violation) to appropriate HTTP responses.
- **Route ordering discipline** — auth checks precede existence checks, so unauthenticated callers can't probe which resources exist.

**PostgreSQL.**

- Parameterized queries throughout — no string interpolation, anywhere.
- Transactions with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` for operations requiring row-level locking, such as fractional position reordering and org membership changes.
- **Cross-organization isolation enforced at the query level** — every JOIN is scoped by organization, preventing any leakage between tenants.

**Auth & authorization.**

- bcryptjs password hashing; stateless JWT bearer tokens.
- RBAC hierarchy `owner > admin > member > viewer`, enforced in middleware with role-comparison guards — verified via mutation testing.

**Organization lifecycle.**

- Auto-join on registration
- Organization switching and assign-to-org flows
- Org deletion with typed confirmation and safe member adoption

### Frontend

React 18 bootstrapped with Vite; React Router 6 for client-side navigation; Context + hooks for app state. The Vite dev server proxies `/auth`, `/orgs`, and `/notifications` to the API on `:3000`. Auth is a JWT held in `localStorage`, managed by a single fetch wrapper.

**Key pieces:**

- **@hello-pangea/dnd** powers the Kanban board with **fractional positioning** — a card dropped between positions 1 and 2 lands at 1.5, avoiding a full-column renumber on every move — paired with optimistic UI updates.
- **Recharts** drives the analytics dashboard: task status and priority breakdowns, a weekly activity grouped bar chart, and a monthly growth composed chart.

**Layout:**

```
index.html            entry document
src/main.jsx          mounts <App />
src/App.jsx           session boot, org selection, view routing, app context
src/api.js            fetch wrapper + typed ApiError, JWT handling, all endpoints
src/constants.js      theme colors, roles, priorities, small format helpers
src/styles.css        all styling
src/views/            AuthGate, Sidebar, Topbar, Dashboard, Board, TaskDrawer,
                      TeamView, SettingsView
```

### Design System — "Drafting Sheet"

An editorial, ledger-inspired aesthetic carried through every chart and piece of UI chrome:

- **Accent:** terracotta `#C4623D`
- **Background:** warm paper `#F4EFE6`
- **Type stack:** Fraunces (display) · Inter (body) · IBM Plex Mono (data & code)

## Roles & Permissions

`viewer < member < admin < owner`. Viewers read; members manage tasks, comments, and attachments; admins manage projects and members; the owner (exactly one, seated at org creation) has full control.

| Action              | Owner | Admin | Member | Viewer |
| ------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: |
| Create organization |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ❌   |   ❌   |
| Manage members      |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ❌   |   ❌   |
| Create projects     |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ❌   |   ❌   |
| Create / edit tasks |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅   |   ❌   |
| View boards         |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅   |   ✅   |

## Engineering Practices

- **End-to-end verification against a live database** rather than assumed behavior.
- **Integration bug detection** by cross-referencing API response shapes against component expectations — not assuming they match.
- **Mutation testing** applied to the security guard middleware.
- A growing test suite covering auth, RBAC, org isolation, and CRUD flows.
- A **security-first review cadence** — two cross-org isolation vulnerabilities and an org-deletion regression were identified and patched during development.
